                ## Keep Your Habits on Track

                Say hello to **Knap**! It’s a fun, low-tech button that helps you remember your daily tasks. When Knap shows red, it’s a gentle reminder to get things done. Press it, and it turns green, signaling you're all set.

                ### How It Works

                - **Red**: Time to do your task.
                - **Green**: Task done!

                No apps, no fuss, just a friendly nudge. Knap makes it easy to stay on top of your goals.
